Weather Forecast Site

This project is a dynamic weather forecasting website that utilizes the WeatherAPI to provide real-time weather updates based on user-specified locations. The site allows users to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales. The implementation focuses on client-side interactions with asynchronous JavaScript for API requests, showcasing the use of promises and async/await patterns. Key features include a search form for location input, real-time display of weather data, and optional loading components for enhanced user experience. The project emphasizes secure handling of API keys through server-side storage and environment variables to prevent unauthorized usage.
